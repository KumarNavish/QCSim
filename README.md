###### Simulation Of A Quantum Computer In Python

This repository is home to a simple python implementation of a quantum computer. You're most welcome to test your own algorithms on it! <br /><br />


A more detailed explanation of the code will be given in the near future in the form of a blog post.  
Until then, don't hesitate to get your hands dirty :) <br />

The code works fine on Python version 3.6.3 with versions of dependencies:

Pandas : v0.20.3,
Matplotlib : v2.1.0,
Numpy : v1.13.3

Steps for installating Pandas: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/install.html

Steps for installing Matplotlib: https://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html

Steps for installing Numpy: https://scipy.org/install.html

Hope you have fun!
